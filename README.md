## Comments:
There's a few things I'd like to improve upon further. The image of the ship doesn't line up with the header links above it. I'm unsure make the quote  slightly to the right while also scaling it using flex box.  `justify-content: center` doesn't look terrible, but it's not quite the same as the example. I think there's also a bit of styling on the buttons that I haven't changed making the bottom/right sides  slightly darker than the upper/left sides.
